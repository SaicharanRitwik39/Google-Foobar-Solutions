Google Foobar is a secret hiring process of Google. I was searching about Geometric Algorithms when the challenge opened up for me. I have progressed through all the Levels (1-5) and these are the solutions to the Google Foobar challenges I received. The following is the breakup of the number of questions in each level.
* LEVEL 1: 1 question (Skipping Work).
* LEVEL 2: 2 questions (Elevator Maintenance, En-Route-Salute).
* LEVEL 3: 3(or 4?) questions (Bomb Baby, Find the Access Codes, Fuel Injection Perfection, Doomsday Fuel).
* LEVEL 4: 2 questions (Escape Pods, Bringing a Gun to Trainer Fight).
* LEVEL 5: 1 question (Dodge the Lasers).

These challenges can be completed in either Python or Java, each challenge is usually solved with a specific algorithm so a decent understanding of data structures and algorithms are recommended. I am more comfortable with Python, so all the solutions in this repo are written in Python.
